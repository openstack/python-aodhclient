   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Python bindings to the Aodh API
===============================

This is a client for Aodh API. There's :doc:`a Python API
<api>` (the :mod:`aodhclient` module), and a :doc:`command-line script
<shell>` (installed as :program:`aodh`). Each implements the entire
Aodh API.

    You may want to read the `Aodh Developer Guide`__  -- the overview, at
    least -- to get an idea of the concepts. By understanding the concepts
    this library should make more sense.
