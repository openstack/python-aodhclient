Python bindings to the OpenStack Aodh API

This is a client for OpenStack Aodh API. There's a `Python API
<https://docs.openstack.org/python-aodhclient/latest/api.html>`_ (the
aodhclient module), and a `command-line script
<https://docs.openstack.org/python-aodhclient/latest/shell.html>`_ (installed
as aodh). Each implements the entire OpenStack Aodh API.
